I"¼<p>I was using Ubuntu and Windows in my laptop for a long period of time. As we are behind a proxy in college and when I go home, I had to change the settings often. So I used ubuntu only when I went home. At a point of time, I very badly wanted to quit windows. Though I like ubuntu, I had a special attraction towards fedora. I installed fedora 11 in my laptop on 1st Nov,2009. Now my laptop has only Fedora. It took one full day to set my laptop to use. ie, to access net, additional packages like unrar, flash etc. I think there will be many noobs like me, who need help to do the installation quicker.  Here I list those which I did as soon as the installation was over.(To access internet)</p>
