I use to celebrate it in a grand fashion. Every year, I go to my school in non-uniform(new dress), distribute sweets to friends and staffs etc. This year, june14th 2009, happened to be a sunday. My second semester examz were going on. I had math exam on 15th. So everyone were serious with their math preparations. I knew that this bâ€™day is gonna be the worst. But my friends at hostel arranged for a chocolate cake. Cut it at 12 am. We settled bak to work within half and hr. Almost all my close friends called me by 12 and greeted me. All my celebs came to an end by around 12.30. Mom and Dad called sharp at 7.59 am, coz i was born at 8 am it seems.</p>
