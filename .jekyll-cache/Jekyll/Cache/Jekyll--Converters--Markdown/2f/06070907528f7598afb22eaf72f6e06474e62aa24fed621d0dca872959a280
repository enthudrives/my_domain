I"¡<p>I remember running my first 8 km and not being able to walk the whole day after. I thought I was just not fit. I tried multiple times, with short distance and long distance running. But my feet hurt so bad that I gave up on running.</p>
<p>A lot of articles suggested that I need better shoes. I bought a pair from Decathlon (40 AUD). It was so comfortable for my zumba classes. I decided to give running another chance. But, Zumba shoes are not running shoes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried couple more shoes from big brands like Nike &amp; Reebok. They were amazing for weight training. But&nbsp;horrendous for running.</p>
<p>At this point, I thought it was just me. <em><b>My feet are not designed for running.</b></em>ðŸ˜’</p>
<p>Few months later, I fell in love with a Nike running shoe, the moment I tried it on. They were so weightless and the soles were thick and comfortable.</p>
<p>The same day I went for a run. <br /><em>I felt like a child who just started running. </em><br />My feet did not hurt!! <br />It made a huge difference in the way I looked at running. <br />It motivated me to keep running.</p>
<p>Choosing the right shoes make a huge difference. Those pair of shoes I am comfortable in, may not be the right fit&nbsp;for you. <strong>Running shoes are an investment</strong>.</p>
<p>It takes time to find your flavor. Don't settle for less comfortable, cheap shoes.</p>
<p>Keep searching for those perfect shoes.ðŸ‘Ÿ</p>
