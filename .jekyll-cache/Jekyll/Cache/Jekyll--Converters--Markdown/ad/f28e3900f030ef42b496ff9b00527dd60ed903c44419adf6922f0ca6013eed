I"p<p>Before 2 yrs, I came to know about Ruby on Rails(RoR) from the internet. I tried learning it. But failed. May be I was very lazy. Recently,I attended a 3 day workshop on Ruby on Rails in my college which helped me to kickstart my RoR learning.
Like I expected, the resource persons were comfy with installing RoR on Windows. They got the exe files in CD. People were running around to get it in their pendrives and installed it on their windows machines. I was sitting in the last bench, installing and learning stuff on my own. Why run for setup files when “yum” or “apt-get” makes things easier for you!! I encountered almost all kinds of errors that could occur on a fedora machine during RoR installation. That is the best part of the workshop. Surfing around lot of forums, I came to know that I am not the only person who suffers from such errors. Errors that occured on my system are quite common among linux RoR-ers. But most of the solutions were available for Ubuntu users. Are there less number of Fedora RoR-ers? I dont know!!
I dedicate this post to all newbies struggling with RoR installation on Fedora ;)</p>
