I"ý<p>Many colleges and companies ban websites like orkut, youtube etc. But inorder to break the rules, we can use proxy sites. But my college keeps banning these proxy sites too!! We too keep finding new proxy sites. As of now, the only proxy site left unbanned is www.sneakyaccess.com . Orkut cannot be accessed using these proxy sites from the past 6 months. The scripts of orkut have been edited. So we use a software called yourfreedom. Visit www.your-freedom.net. Download -&gt; Configure -&gt; Enjoy!</p>
