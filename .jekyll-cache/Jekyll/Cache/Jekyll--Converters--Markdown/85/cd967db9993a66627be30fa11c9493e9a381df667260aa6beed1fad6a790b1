I"–<p>In my place, Diwali is more like a festival of sound, than festival of lights. We burst hell lot of crackers every year. I learnt to burst crackers when I was 6 years old. Started off with Bijili vedi. Later improved to Laxmi vedi, atom bomb etc in the following years.<br />
Every Diwali has left behind some crazy memories. Let me share one of them here.</p>

<p>When I was 10, I was bursting some laxmi crackers in the morning. My parents were away and friends too left. One cracker didnot burst. I waited for a while and went near it. No smoke from it. So, I thought that the cracker is a dummy piece and took it in my hand. The thread(thiri) had gone in. I poked the thread hole with a stick and it suddenly burst in my hands. Only after that I noticed that the stick in my hand was a lit bathi(incense stick). Smoke came out from my mouth and ears(Just like <strong>Vadivelu</strong> in movies) :P <br />
Thank God, no one saw me at that moment. I continued bursting crackers like nothing happened. Later my mom found the wound in my hand and the real diwali started for me :P</p>

<p>Chinna vayasulayae terror la!! :D</p>

<p>Happy and Safe Diwali everyone :)</p>
