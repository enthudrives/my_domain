Only I have the rights on it. No one else does!‚Äù. This feeling might seem funny. But it is dangerous. Normally, most of the people suffer from this hard feeling ontheir beloved ones. This is due to their fear of losing them.Most of the people are possessive on their girl friend or boy friend. This is actually because the possessive soul considers his mate more valuable, precious that he/she is not ready to lose them. They want their mate to spend time only with them and for them. This possessiveness makes them prevent their mate from speaking with the opposite sex. But the mate might interpret this as suspection. This leads to lot of problems in their relationships and finally ends with a break up!</p>
