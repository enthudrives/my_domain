I"ƒ<p>FRIENDS is my most favourite sitcom so far. I never thought that I could get addicted to this sitcom. Because, I had a problem with those random voices which laugh hysterically in the middle of a conversation. But later, my brain found its way to filter out those laughters from bothering my system. I tried to start watching many times. But failed right at the Season1 Episode1.</p>
