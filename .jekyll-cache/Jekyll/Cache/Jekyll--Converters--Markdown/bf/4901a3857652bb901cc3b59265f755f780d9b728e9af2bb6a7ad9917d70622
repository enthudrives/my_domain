I"ˆ<p>I have been in Pune in the last 2.5 months and food was not a big problem for me.Â I enjoy the poha, paav, rottis here.Â Though I see rice as a part of lunch menu, I rarely take it because I donâ€™t wanna eat the so called sambar there. But I am not cribbing. Because I had happy meal everyday. I never <em>craved</em> for idli/sambar or a proper lunch with sambar, rasam and curd. Â </p>
