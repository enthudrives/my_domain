This is my rookie attempt at writing a poem for a very special friend of mine.

It's 6 in the evening,
I wait for your ping,
I then realize,
You are not here to walk me home.

It's Saturday evening,
I look out of my balcony,
I then realize,
You are not here to explore the streetsÂ with me.

It's time for some shopping,
I look at clothes,
I then realize,
You are not here to say, we don't wear these.

Lost in memories,
I walk back home,
I then realize,
You are not here to drag me while crossing the road.

Every girl needs a friend like you.
My Life will never be the same, Without you..

I miss you girl!
