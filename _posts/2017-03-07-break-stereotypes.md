Dear women,
<p>
Don't get carried away by the stereotypes set by media;<br/>
Nobody but you can define what you are capable of.
</p>
Don't be intimidated by the men in the floor;<br/>
Your skills are equally important as theirs.

Don't be afraid of being wrong;<br/>
Everyone makes mistakes and so will you.

You are strong. You are beautiful;<br/> 
Feel free to express yourself.<br/>

Let not the stereotypes stop you from expressing yourself.<br/>

<i>
This International Women's day, I pledge to be bold for change and challenge stereotypes.
