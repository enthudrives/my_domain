For weeks, I jumped next to this box, to see if I will be able to jump on this box, without breaking a bone or two. Guess what. It looked like I couldn't jump high enough to land on the box.Â One fine day, I gathered my guts and jumped on the box. To my surprise, I landed on the box. I kept jumpingÂ again and again and a 50 times more.Â ðŸ˜†

_You don't know what you are capable of unless you try_.Â It is important to kick yourself out of your comfort zone often, so that you can track your progress and keep challenging yourself with new goals.

After a long day at work, it is easy to crash on the couch, eat some junkÂ and watch tv for the rest of the evening. Is that what you want to remember, when you look back at your life 5 years from now?

_Define yourself. Not for others. But for yourself.Â ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜‡_
