I've been thinking about hosting my blog on github pages for ages. I finally made the big move, from Wordpress to Jekyll.
<ul>  
<li> I get to write my blog posts in my favorite IDE now. <i>Jetbrains</i> ðŸ’“</li>
<li> I get to commit my blog posts in <code>github</code>.</li>
<li> I get to customize my theme.</li>
<li> I can host it on github-pages.</li>
<li> I can write my own plugins in ruby.</li>
</ul>

I am using Long-haul theme by <a href="https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul">@brianmaierjr</a>. I've customized it by adding Disqus for comments; And Instagram plugin to embed instagram posts. 

I will share about my learnings with Jekyll soon. Meanwhile, if you have experimented with Jekyll, please leave some tips or suggestions below.
