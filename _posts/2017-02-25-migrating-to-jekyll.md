<p>Jekyll is a ruby gem which is used to build static websites. I chose Jekyll over Wordpress for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>  
<li> I get to commit my blog posts in github <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>.</li>
<li> I get to customize my theme.</li>
<li> I can host it on github-pages.</li>
<li> I can write my own plugins in ruby ðŸ’“.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've been thinking about hosting my blog on github pages for ages. I finally made the big move, from Wordpress to Jekyll. 
I am using Long-haul theme by <a href="https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul">@brianmaierjr</a>. I've customized it by adding Disqus for comments and Instagram plugin to embed instagram posts. </p>

I will share about my learnings with Jekyll soon. Meanwhile, if you have experimented with Jekyll, please leave some tips or suggestions below.
