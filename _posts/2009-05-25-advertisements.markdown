I have wondered many days, why lot of adverisements are put up in websites and even blogs.  
Are they harmful? Virus prone? Unsafe to click? Why this person has published all these links(at times idiotic links) in his blog?  
But I realised a few days ago that, advertisements help people in earning money. Advertisers publish their ads through companies like adbrite,adsense etc. And if you are ready to give room for these advertisements in your web-page, you will be paid for every click that is made on these ads. Amazing fact that we get money doing nothing :D  
So Donot hesitate to click ads found on websites.Some ads are available in my blog also. Even if you don't gain anything from it, do click it. Just a click will do. ;)
