Most of you would be aware of the fact that we cannot create a folder named con.

Why isnt it possible? The reason is, con refers to "console". An older way of creating a file in command prompt is "copy con myfile.txt".

But, you can create it using command prompt. Have you ever tried?

mkdir \\.\c:\con

This helps you creating a folder named con.
