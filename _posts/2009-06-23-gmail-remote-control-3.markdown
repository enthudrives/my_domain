GRC allows you to control your system by sending commands via mail. To do this, you need a simple software calledGRC. To download it, visit www.gianniamato.it. That website is in french I guess. I can give you the direct link to download.Here we go

http://www.gianniamato.it/grc/GRC.zip

All you have to do is hust unzip it. Run the file GRC.exe

Trust me. Its not virus!!

Now, you will be able to see this window.

Sign in here with your gmail id and password. 

  


Once you are logged in with GRC, it checks your inbox every 60 seconds for new command mails. 

  


For example, I wanna open my system's calculator. I mailed my email id from my friend's id(another laptop) with the subject [open]c:\windows\system32\calc.exe[/open]

Yep it worked!!!

Calculator opened on my desktop. 

  


This can be misused easily. Like, if I know that you have your GRC opened, I will mail you with subject shutdown and your system will be off. 

It is possible for GRC users to change their commands.

This is what it looks like by default. If you want to change the shutdown command to turnoff, just edit it. You are safe now..!!

You can use your web cam this way to protect your place when you are away. 

Now its your turn to experiment with it..

  


P.S: This works only with windows xp for nw.
