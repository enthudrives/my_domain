[![](https://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/smalgal1.jpg?w=300)](https://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/smalgal1.jpg) All I am gonna write is from my own experience. This is the problem faced by many people like me. First let me give a brief intro of myself. 

Born in a middle class family in Tirunelveli(a not so developed city). Only daughter to my parents. Had a good neighbourhood. Lot of good friends since childhood. Not just friends. I would say "another family" rather. I dint have the feeling that am the only child. Was surrounded by friends often. 

Now let me say about my schooling. Did till my 10th in a good Convent school.Convent schools do not just spread Christian religion.They preach True Christian values;True definition of Human Life. This school had taught me loads about Life;purity of soul;Eternal Glory; Virtues. The motto of my school is "Virtue is our strongest shield".  It is a Girls' school. The teachers were partial.  I dint get any oppurtunity to realise my hidden talents till my 8th. I realised that I had a very good leadership quality from my English Teacher, in my 8th class. My class teacher in 9th n 10th, she showed me who I am exactly. Now I enter my Higher Secondary Schooling. I entered an orthodox Hindu school(contradictory right?). I got a hand full of good friends by the end of 11th class. All of us enjoyed learning. All of us were almost of the same kind. I felt great when I was accompanied by all those people. Lion may be the king of the Forest;But its pride increases when it is surrounded by many other  lions. None of us had any kind of jealous or superiority complex. Our friendship became thicker during the summer vacation(after my exams were over). We knew very well that we may be seperated (by distance) when we enter college. But still, this fear dint affect our happiness at that time.  Now,College life. I am in a very good institution(in Chennai,a developed city) now. I have met a lot of people now. Here too I have a number of friends. They are from various parts of the State. A few from other states too. Lots of changes in behavior,attitude,topics in which people are interested etc.May be, it is all the effects of westernisation! But still I enjoy Life in my own way. But the difference is, I wear the mask of a quiet gal in the coll.I dint change myself to a quiet gal. Coz,still there are people who says that I am a chatterbox!!!  Till the end of 12th,I had more than 100 good friends. The way we mingle with each other is entirely different from those people whom I met in my coll.I was surrounded by friends all the time. I have never felt lonely before. What people near me tell often is,"You are the source of Joy". But now!! I couldn't find even a single soul like my school pals. Words couldn't explain,how a gal brought up like me would feel under this situation.Everyday is a battlefield. I could take this too in an optimistic manner. These incidents too teach me about what Life. Every incident teaches something about Life. I learnt to be what I am, whereever I am. Mind filled with Golden memories;Eyes filled with tears,in search of them. Will I get back those golden days?

As days pass by, I got used to all these and realised that I need a change. I revealed the mask. Back to form. Happy with my new friends in college. Realised that "Things are not what they seem".  Got to know people who could understand me the way I am. They too taught me lot of lessons in life. Lovable pals gave good times at college.  I came across a few cunning people in my Life. They too taught me great lessons like Never trust anyone.

Miss you all,my dear school friends, Teachers and everyone, who moulded me into what I am now. I will be thankful to all of you forever and ever.
