![](http://wizkid91.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/wa.jpg?w=300) Input your question. They generate your output.  Wolfram alpha is a search engine where you get answers for your questions.  It is very often referred to as "computational knowledge engine."  Fpr eg, I entered the question "How old are you?". It returned its age since it was launched. This search engine is in its developed stage. So you cannot expect answers for all your questions. As of now, you can know about any particular date,town,stocks,mathematical formulae,calculations. The search engine was launched before a month. Let us wait for it to get developed. :)
