I have been in Pune in the last 2.5 months and food was not a big problem for me. I enjoy the poha, paav, rottis here. Though I see rice as a part of lunch menu, I rarely take it because I don't wanna eat the so called sambar there. But I am not cribbing. Because I had happy meal everyday. I never *craved* for idli/sambar or a proper lunch with sambar, rasam and curd.  

Unless.....

2 weeks back, I went to Bangalore for a weekend. Just looking at Adyar Anandha Bhavan got a wide smile on my face. The smell of filter coffee got me high and that is when I realised how much of a South Indian I am..!
