Many colleges and companies ban websites like orkut, youtube etc. But inorder to break the rules, we can use proxy sites. But my college keeps banning these proxy sites too!! We too keep finding new proxy sites. As of now, the only proxy site left unbanned is www.sneakyaccess.com . Orkut cannot be accessed using these proxy sites from the past 6 months. The scripts of orkut have been edited. So we use a software called yourfreedom. Visit www.your-freedom.net. Download -> Configure -> Enjoy!

The advantage is that they don't ban this software in my college. Actually, this software cannot be banned it seems. It uses a different protocol. So they cannot detect who uses it and who doesnt. Also they can't find what websites we visit.Â
