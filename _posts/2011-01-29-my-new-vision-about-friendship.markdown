I got a new vision about friendship a few days back. I wanted to share it with you guys. But tweets/facebook status msgs cannot be too long. So I decided to write this blog post.  
  
I classify friendship into two types. Friendship with those who  


  

  1. naturally become friends with no intention.  
(Classmates, colleagues, neighbours etc)  

  2. become friends coz of some reason or presumption about us.  
(Social networking, friend's friend etc)  
  
We tend to get close to the 2nd kind of friends so easily. We often tend to ignore the 1st category ones for the later.  
But if we analyse our friendship, we can see that the 1st kind of friends are more affectionate and caring towards us.  


<blockquote>True friendship is not about shaking hands in the best times. It is about holding hands even in the most painful situation.</blockquote>

  
This is just my opinion. Comments are welcomed.
