Ever since I walked into my college gym and picked the barbell for the first time, I knew that I was passionate about fitness. But just like many other women, I got the misconception that Treadmill and cross-trainer were my only options; Barbells and Dumbbells will make my hands look dude-like.

I was never regular to the gym because running/cycling in the same place felt boring. Over the last three years, I have joined & quit two gyms. The max number of consecutive sessions I've lasted is 3. :P I just didn't feel as connected with the routines as much as I could with Swimming or doing Zumba.

Earlier in 2015, when I was in Brussels, I was living opposite to a Cross-fit gym. I used to look at all those super fit women working out there. Oh boy! How I wish I could tone my muscles like that!

Later in 2015, I visited the Gold's gym, thanks to my husband. I had no intentions of joining the gym, because I was happy with my zumba membership(lost 5 kg in 3 months). The manager at the Gym explained me about how lame it is, to just do cardio and expect a toned body. I did some reading about muscle mass, strength training and decided to take up the gym membership.

I've been going to the gym regularly for 1.5 months now and I can already feel the difference. My daily routine includes 15-20 minutes of cardio and 45 minutes of weight training. According to the Body Composition Analyser, my muscle mass has increased by 1 kg. Yay!
