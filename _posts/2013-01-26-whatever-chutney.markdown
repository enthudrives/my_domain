I've always thought making Chutney is a short, yet more complicated process than washing badly soiled utensils.

Here's the recipe:

  * Peel about 20 onions.
  * Chop them to medium sized pieces.
  * Slize 2 tomatoes into 4 (or 6) pieces each.

50% of the work done!

In a frying pan, pour a tea spoon oil, let it heat for about 30 seconds; Add some mustard & urad dhal. Wait till it splutters. Add 2 red chillies, 5 pieces of garlic and some curry leaves. Add the chopped onions, tomatoes and fry for about 3 minutes. 

Turn off the stove and take a break for 5 mins. If you don't let it cool down for a while, the mixie jar will become hot.

Then, grind all these beautifully fried ingredients in a mixie. Add salt to taste. I normally add a teaspoon of salt.

Tada. Chutney ready. 

If you add more tomatoes, you can call it tomato chutney. more chillies? Call it Kara chutney(spicy chutney). After all, Whats in a name? :)
