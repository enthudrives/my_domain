Atheists say that GOD doesnt exist. But I am no atheist. There are people who create diversity among people in the name of religion. I am not such a person also. I belong to another group of people who believe in the uniqueness of GOD. 

  


I hope you believe that GOD created all of us. Also the animals, birds, trees etc. There are two different terms,GOD and Lord.

According to me, God is the creator. People who were really good in some way are Lords. (hope u know about immortality of soul) God cannot manage this big Universe. So Lords(who are specially talented) assist God. Sounds funny huh?  


An incident:

One day, there arose this kind of discussion in my English class. I was whispering this. My neighbour stared at me and started laughing. I hesitated to say it aloud. After few minutes of argument, my English master gave the same explanation as I did; He added that this explanation was provided by some saint in his book(written centuries agao)! My neighbour was amazed! Even I was. 

  


God who created us knows what is good and what is bad. Also He knows what we need and when we need. God is ready to present you the most valuable gifts in this World. But you are not ready to accept them. You keep asking God every second. But you never listen to his words. 

  


Why God doesnt respond me when I was in trouble?

God knows that I know to come out of that situation myself; or probably God wants me to learn a lesson; gain experience out of it.

  


Why God didnot help me overcome my failure?

Because,God wanted me to know the pain of failure; to realize my mistakes; to realize why I lost;To realize never to repeat it again.

  


If you are depressed or feel like you need something, you go to the temple; perform ceremonies; pray God. But have you ever done all these when you are happy?? You fail to thank God when you are happy. But still God keeps giving you. You may forget God. But He never does.

  


I don't believe in going to temples; ceremonies and all those. I believe that God is everywhere. God speaks to you in the form of your conscience. God resides in your mind. Keep your mind clean and tidy,to the extent the monks keep the temple clean. So, be truthful to yourself. That is more than enough. God will be happy.
