This is a poem from my wallpaper. Inspirational.

Say to yourself every morning:


<blockquote>Today is going to be a great day!

I can handle more things than I think I can!

Things don't get better by worrying about them!

I can be satisfied if I try to do my best!

There is always something to be happy about!

I'm going to make someone happy today!

It's not good to be down!

Life is great, make the most of it!

Be an Optimist!!</blockquote>
