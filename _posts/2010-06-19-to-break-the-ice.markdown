This blog is about the first application I created. It is not a very complicated one. So if you expect something great, please change your opinion before you read further. 

Everytime the Anna university results are out, we calculate the GPA not only for us but also for our friends and enemies. It takes a hell lot of time to manually convert the characters S,A,B,.. to GPA 9,8.233 and so on.

This vacation(after my 4th sem) is a pretty lenghty one. I did ruin my time. One bluemoon day, I thought of doing something with my qt creator. At this moment, I got the idea of making a GUI tool for calculating the GPA. The logic behind calculating the GPA is too simple. The only task is to create the interface. 

The application came out well in 3 hrs. Success! :)

My work did not end with creating the binary file(executable file).My friend Arun SAG guided me through the rest. He very patiently guided me through creating the readme, working with version management(git). Then I realised writing the code is just 50% of the project. Documentation is another big task. 

You can calculate the GPA for as many people you want by just changing the grade. The credits will remain constant till you close the window. :)
