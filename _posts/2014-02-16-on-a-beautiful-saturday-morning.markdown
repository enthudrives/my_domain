The auto driver told us that it is a good 2 km walk from the Mumbai-Pune Express highway to Karla caves. It was a pleasant morning with chill breeze. So, we(2 of my friends and I) decided to walk down the beautiful road.

The road passed through a small beautiful village, with vehicles crossing us on and off. Just as we were enjoying the pleasant, un-polluted breeze, we noticed a XUV stalking us. They had crossed us twice already. And this time we noticed that the car slowed down near us and the two guys from the car staring at us. Within 10 seconds, we heard the car taking a turn and following us, yet again.

Yes, all of us had smart phones. But none of the applications could protect us in that situation. There are so many applications which would send out help texts with our location to friends or cops. But anything could have happened before some helping hand could reach us. I tweeted immediately, so that my location is known, at least to my followers. Just in case.

We got a bit more nervous as we noticed that there were no houses around, after 50 metres from now. Two ladies were sitting outside a house nearby. We went over to their place and explained what was happening. These morons in XUV drove around that house, twice from the time we went there. They slowed down in front of the house and kept staring at us.

Then, two guys came out of this house. The XUV guys moved away from the house. But they were waiting for us, a little ahead.

The folks of this house were very caring. They sat us down in their house; offered chaai. They decided to drop us at Karla Caves in their car and gave their phone number just in case we needed any help.

Three girls cannot walk peacefully walk on a beautiful road at 10 in the morning?? Can't imagine what these guys would have been up to if not for the nice folks who drove us down that road.
