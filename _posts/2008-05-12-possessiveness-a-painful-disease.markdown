Only I have the rights on it. No one else does!". This feeling might seem funny. But it is dangerous. Normally, most of the people suffer from this hard feeling ontheir beloved ones. This is due to their fear of losing them.Most of the people are possessive on their girl friend or boy friend. This is actually because the possessive soul considers his mate more valuable, precious that he/she is not ready to lose them. They want their mate to spend time only with them and for them. This possessiveness makes them prevent their mate from speaking with the opposite sex. But the mate might interpret this as suspection. This leads to lot of problems in their relationships and finally ends with a break up!

But also between friends. If your true friend starts talking more with someone else even when you are near, you will feel left alone. You may feel that you are ignored;insecure etc. And you may even yell at your friend for no reason.

You will realise that you are not ignored. Your friend will not go anywhere. If at all your friend leaves you, let him go. He will come back realizing your worth.

They are never used to sharing things. They want everything their way. They expect full love from their friends. They would not let it shared by anyone. There is no room to blame possessive people. It is better to make them overcome possessiveness and maintain a healthy relationship with people in the society.  
  


People often confuse with the words "Possessiveness" and "Jealousy". Jealousy may arise even without love. But possessiveness comes out of true love from within. 

Don't hate your mates for being possessive. If a person is possessive on you, it means that he loves you very much and expects the same love from you.
