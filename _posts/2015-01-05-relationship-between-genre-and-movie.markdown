I've always been confused between the relationship between Movie and Genre while thinking of the basic CRUD app for movies or books. There are two options that my brain suggests me.  
  


  1. Movie** has one **Genre
  2. Genre **has many** Movies

I think it's because of my colloquial dialect, that I had this confused in my head, Movie has a title. Movie has a story. And movie **belongs to** a genre. Hence, the relationship between Genre and Movie is clearly option 2.
