I've been thinking about hosting my blog on github pages for ages. I finally made the big move, from Wordpress to Jekyll. 
- I get to write my blog posts in my favorite IDE now. **Jetbrains** ðŸ’“
- I get to commit my blog posts in `github`.
- I get to customize my theme.
- I can host it on github-pages.
- I can write my own plugins in ruby.

I have added Disqus for comments; Google Analytics for Analysis; And Instagram plugin to embed instagram posts.
