I am 26 old Software Engineer/Consultant. I love coding. I love solving problems in the simplest possible way. I give my fullest to make sure I deliver value to the team and my team delivers value to our client. I have never felt less competent when compared to my male colleagues. 

I have always challenged biases and thrived to breaking stereotypes. I can't tolerate any form of discrimination. Lately, I have been paying closer attention to understand unconscious biases in people at workplace.

<i>Someone walks to my desk, asks my male counterpart about the system which I built and I have the most context on. Of course my male colleague knows about the system; He explains it. I jump in to fill the missing pieces. </i>

<i>In a team meeting, stakeholder asks him "Do you think we can use tool X to solve this problem?".<br/> 
I reply, "I have played around with it. I am confident that it is doable." </i>

<i>It was his idea to build this feature. Stakeholder asks implementation details to him.<br/>
I suggested the feature that we are building now. Still, stakeholder asks implementation details to him. </i>

Come on Suganthi. Don't be a silly feminist, you could say. It was just a one-off, you could say. I tell you my friend, this has happened - not just once. And I could keep quoting incidents to prove that.

Initially, I was so certain that I am imagining things. Nobody else seems to notice this problem. I cannot accuse this person of discriminating against me. What if they are just not comfortable talking to me? What if I am the problem? 

How often have you blamed yourself for somebody else's biases? <i>My boss did not listen to my idea because it was lame. </i>
<i>I did not get that project because he is more competent than I am </i>. <i>He got to go on that business trip because I did not have enough experience to handle that tough client</i>.

You can't beat yourself for other people's biases. People have their unconscious biases. It is not your fault. Fight for what is yours. Be confident of your skills and please don't let go of your opportunities because someone thinks you don't deserve it.       

I am not saying that this happens only to women. This happens to people who are smart, though they have few years of experience. I have told myself in my early days - This is happening because you are too young. 

It's a pity that there are not many female engineers out there. So, not many people have had the privilege to work with women software engineers. This has caused some serious biases in people's minds about how women are not as competent as men in this job. 

To help change this situation, the first step you can take is by being aware of the **unconscious** biases you may have. 
It is not your fault that you have some biases. Being aware helps you make an effort to look beyond them and challenge them.

Next time when someone asks you a question and you know that your female colleague has more context on, mindfully redirect 
the question to her, and ask her opinion on it.  

If you feel discriminated, do talk about it. It helps your colleagues be mindful of situations which often go unnoticed. 
Also it helps to blog about it, so that it makes an impact on people beyond your workplace to watch out for unconscious biases.
