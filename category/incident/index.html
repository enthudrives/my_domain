        <h5>2012-02-16 03:25:15 +1100</h5>
        <p><p>On a pleasant evening, I met Aakriti sitting alone under a tree and enjoying the beauty of Sunset. I sat next to her and started cracking lame jokes. Her reactions were so unusual and it forced me to ask her “Are you alright?”. She stared at me for a second and asked me if I had loved someone. Before I could reply, a teardrop rolled down her eyes. Her boyfriend broke up with her before a few days.</p>

        <h5>2012-02-04 00:19:04 +1100</h5>
        <p><p>I recently attended the thoughtworks recruitment process. I would like to share my experience about the same.
The process had 6 rounds.
<strong> 1. Logic Test</strong>
** 2. Predicting output (20 mins)**
You will be given with 4 not-too-complex programs which involves pointers, left shift, right shift operators. You need to predict their outputs.
<strong>3. Code pairing(75 mins)</strong>
You will be given with a simple scenario and asked to code for the same. You can use C or C++ or Java. Make your code more object oriented and modular. If you use C, concentrate on modularity. Once you get the expected output, one ThoughtWorks employee will evaluate your code. He will check with the test cases. Then, he will want you to do some modifications in your code. He might ask you to extend your code  or modify some functionality of your code.
** 4. Tech Interviews 1 &amp; 2**
To ace the interviews, you need to be strong in the basics OOP, DS, DBMS. “Strong” doesnt mean knowing all definitions. You will be given with some scenario and asked to write db tables and classes for the same. Or you may be given a scenario and asked what data structure can be applied for it. Theres no correct solution for most of the questions they ask in the interview. They just want to look at your thought process. So, dont give up. Keep thinking and most importantly, speak out what you think. Who knows..your answer may be right. Be honest. If you dont know something, admit it.</p>

        <h5>2011-10-26 00:51:00 +1100</h5>
        <p><p>In my place, Diwali is more like a festival of sound, than festival of lights. We burst hell lot of crackers every year. I learnt to burst crackers when I was 6 years old. Started off with Bijili vedi. Later improved to Laxmi vedi, atom bomb etc in the following years.<br />
Every Diwali has left behind some crazy memories. Let me share one of them here.</p>

<p>When I was 10, I was bursting some laxmi crackers in the morning. My parents were away and friends too left. One cracker didnot burst. I waited for a while and went near it. No smoke from it. So, I thought that the cracker is a dummy piece and took it in my hand. The thread(thiri) had gone in. I poked the thread hole with a stick and it suddenly burst in my hands. Only after that I noticed that the stick in my hand was a lit bathi(incense stick). Smoke came out from my mouth and ears(Just like <strong>Vadivelu</strong> in movies) :P <br />
Thank God, no one saw me at that moment. I continued bursting crackers like nothing happened. Later my mom found the wound in my hand and the real diwali started for me :P</p>

<p>Chinna vayasulayae terror la!! :D</p>

<p>Happy and Safe Diwali everyone :)</p>
